          It was the dream of Dr.Kurunji  Venkatramana Gowda that English Education must be accessible to the inquisitive minds of Sullia and its neighbouring places.
          <br/>

          It was in the year 2008 that Dr.Renuka Prasad K.V felt the need for a CBSE school in this serene land. His desire was fostered by his belief that “Children must be taught how to think, not what to think”. Dr.Jyothi R.Prasad joined hands with him in his mission. The school started with a humble beginning. As the years passed by the school earned good name and fame. The strength of the school today is its dynamic faculty who could make the students to think. Within a short span of time the school is recognized globally. Some of its accomplishments include International School Award sponsored by the British Council, U.K., First Place at the CBSE Regional Level Science Exhibition, Wonderla Environment and Energy Conservation Award and many more. KVGIPS is known for academic excellence, child centred  activity based education and world class infrastructure.

        <p class="about-elab hero-text">
          Education has always been a cornerstone of society, the pillar on which the bulwark of human existence rests, the leading light as mankind made his way in quest of the unknown. While the art and science of education may have undergone changes since the time of yore, every educationist strives to instill in every student a sense of virtue and wisdom, sensitivity to the needs of others, the skills, the attitudes and habits that would help them explore and excel, a quest for knowledge and the power of action. All of these would propel each one to an all important goal – Excellence.<br/>

At KVG International Public School, it is our endeavour to delve deeper into the true purpose of education by giving our students opportunities and an environment that is positive, inspiring, challenging and stimulating. We want each one of our students to follow their bliss, blaze new trails and open new doors. I am proud of the parents and teachers who care, nurture and reassure the children.
<br/>
Scientists say that as per aerodynamics, the honey bee cannot fly. Its wings are not proportionate to the shape and size of its body and so scientifically speaking it is not possible for the honey bee to fly. But we know that the honey bee flies effortlessly. This is simply because the bee does not know the above fact and is so conditioned by it. The bee is aware of only one thing that it can and is sure to fly, and so it does. Keeping the very principle in mind we in the school endeavor to motivate our budding talents to persevere like the honey bee, and achieve success.<br/>

I assure that KVGIPS will always remain the foremost temple of learning, where there are “equal opportunities to all so that they rise to their fullest potential”.<br/>

The architect of Sullia Dr. KURUNJI VENKATRAMANA GOWDA Founder President, Academy of Liberal Education(R), Sullia has converted Sullia, a tiny village into a modern learning centre of the country.

His contribution in making this small town a VIDHYA KASHI is highly commendable.

Keeping in pace with globalization he has committed to promote quality, competency, innovation and continuous improvements in learning. He made strong appeal to the young intellectuals to strive hard to strengthen the knowledge based economy. The intellectual park is so amazing and has reached the pinnacle. The Academy of Liberal Education (R) Sullia today is an educational hub with more than fifty educational institutions. Once an offspring steps into the play home of this park, can come out gracefully with Ph.D Degree. K.V.G International Public School and KVG Play Home and Kindergarten have emerged as one of the pioneer institutions in providing quality education and thus catering to the needs of the society at large.

Dr. Kurunji Venkatramana Gowda is an educationist, a social reformer, a philosopher, a great preacher and an able administrator; above all a great philanthropist. All these have made him a Living Legend.

He is the source of Inspiration to all of us. His ideals and way of working are to be imbibed in everybody’s life. He has a dream of making our country modern and strong by spreading intellectual spirituality. We at KVGIPS & KVG Play Home and Kindergarten remain immensely grateful to him for all his blessings and patronage in bringing up this institution

       <strong>“On the road to success, the rule is always to look ahead…”</strong> <br/>

        It was the dream and demand of the people of Sullia to have a sound secondary school with C. B. S. E. curriculum, which provides quality education. Keeping in view of this, the academy of Liberal of Education (R.) Sullia, the pioneers in Rural Education ventured into starting K.V.G. International Public School in the year 2008.
        <br/>
        It gives us an immense sense of happiness and honor to place on records that KVG International Public School and KVG Play Home and Kindergarten cater to the needs of the inquisitive learners from Sullia and its neighbouring places.
        <br/>
        With the changing paradigms of education which hold no space for rote learning and passive listening, we will continue to provide our students with opportunities and situations that facilitate them to exhibit their hidden potential to the fullest. We strongly believe that today’s generation has an unquenchable thirst to seek knowledge that cannot be satiated by traditional methods of teaching. KVGIPS with an infrastructure confirming to global standards and an array of opportunities to tap on individual talent is all set to edify the young learners keeping in view a synchronous growth of their body, mind and soul.
        <br/>
        We in the school focus on each and every child, monitor and mentor them, appreciate their achievements and encourage them to overcome their shortcomings. Our teachers create appropriate, meaningful and participative learning situations, inculcating Life Skills in the impressionable children and appreciating their minutest efforts with all generosity and broadness of vision. We look forward for the constant support and patronage of all the stake holders in all our ventures.
